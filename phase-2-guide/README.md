### What Do We Work On?

##### Pair Challenges
Pair challenges are handed out every morning, and are intended to give an
isolated look at at the technical topics we'll be covering.

##### Group Projects
Group projects are a great way to bring together everything you've learned from the week and learn to work on a team. There is always more to do, more enhancements to be made, more
features to be added, and more bugs to fix. But you will create something to be proud of and to learn from. 

##### Engineering Empathy
A key part of being an exceptional junior developer is sensitivity to your code,
yourself and the people around you. Emotional intelligence training will help
you become more self aware of how you learn and engage with teams.
