#### Writing Prompts

1. Before you receive your code review, write down a prediction about how you did on each of the 5 sections of the assessment.

2. After you receive your code review, reflect upon the following questions and write down your thoughts.  For each question, create a specific list of strategies or activities.

- How accurate were my predictions for each portion of the assessment?

----------

- What did I do to prepare for this assessment technically? 
- What did I do to prepare for this assessment mentally and emotionally?

----------

- Where did I have difficulties on the assessment technically?
- Where did I have difficulties on the assessment mentally and emotionally?

----------

- Where were my successes technically?
- Where were my successes mentally and emotionally?

----------

- What will I do differently in my preparation for the next assessment technically and mentally?
- What will I do differently when taking my next assessment technically and mentally?

#### Making it a habit

- We will regularly revisit these reflections and discuss them with our peers to help make this a habit and create a cycle of feedback and iteration.
