#TripleB
##A roadside assistance community for bike riders

With a TripleB account, users can easily publish "alerts" which act as beacons to
mechanics and other riders in the area. These other users can then respond to your alert
and offer assistance. Upon offering assistance, phone numbers are shared and details can be worked out
between individual users. You'll never have carry your busted bike home again!

Later versions will include payment/tip processing, as well as a map of participating bike shops.

TripleB was built as a DevBootcamp final project by:

[Ernesto](https://github.com/emjrdev), and
